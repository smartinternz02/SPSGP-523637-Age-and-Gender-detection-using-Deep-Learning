The previous systemâ€™s machine learning algorithms were not utilized to improve classification skills for a vast
number of images and data available via the internet. In this project, Deep Learning techniques are used to
reliably estimate a person's gender and age from a single facial capture. 'Male' or 'Female' will be the predicted
gender. We might use age categories based on the experiment to forecast a person's age. The eyes are one of
the most essential aspects of face images in various applications such as facial recognition and emotional
expression. Human Facial Image Processing gives numerous hints and signs that can be applied to a variety
of businesses, security, entertainment, and others. The expression on a person's face can reveal a lot of
information about them, such as their emotional condition, the slightest agreement or disagreement, irony or
fury, and so on. Faces have become an important subject of study in psychology for this reason. Gender
detection can provide a wealth of information to firms' recruitment teams, for example. Verification of ID
cards, such as voter ID cards, which are used by millions of people to vote in elections, and so on. Finding
ineligible or fraudulent individuals is made easier with human facial image analysis.
