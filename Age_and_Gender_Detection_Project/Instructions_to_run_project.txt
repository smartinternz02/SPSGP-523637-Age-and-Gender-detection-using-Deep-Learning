Hello sir/madam, Hope you are doing great!


-------------------------- Method # 1 to Run project on your Machine ----------------------

You will find a file named as "packages_used_in_project.txt" , which contain all module names with pip installation command;

So, install them all and execute the below command in your terminal or just run app.py file as you run any python file:
				      python app.py


-------------------------- Method # 2 to Run project on your Machine -----------------------

Strategy: Create a anaconda environment using provided YAML file (conda_requirements_yml.yml) 

To create anaconda environment;

Install anaconda on your machine, open anaconda and  Navigate to Environments on the left then click on import  and then select "conda_requirements_yml.yml" from the Project folder. 

Now activate the created enviorement and launch the  VS Code in anaconda and execute "app.py"  from the Project folder.

This will create a server for the flask App, and follow that link.

Thank you!!!!!
